# Data Mining Project

## Overview
This project implements and compares different data sampling techniques for network traffic classification using machine learning models. The system evaluates stratified sampling, K-means clustering, and HDBSCAN clustering methods on cybersecurity datasets, training both Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines for binary and multiclass classification.
